# 6502_Emulator

An emulator for the 6502 processor written in Python for a class in computer organization and arcitecture. 

Included in this project are test files that can be run on the pseduo command line, as well as a large suite of sample runs as tests. This was originally meant to ensure functionality for the class but now allows for specific behavior to be targeted if I'd like to develop the emulator further.

The project itself is in pycharm, and may be moved to a more vanilla structure when worked on again.
